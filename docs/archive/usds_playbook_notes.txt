Who are the primary users?
-	Nationwide chain of hospitals, drug stores, etc. Anyone distributing pharmaceuticals over a wide supply chain. Especially if the supply chain is not integrated.
What user needs will this service address?
-	Visual perspective of recalled drugs by geography.
Why does the user want or need this service?
-	Liability and malpractice.
Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?
-	TBD
Which research methods were used?
-	In person interviews during prototyping.
-	Daily review and planning meetings involving multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.
-	Agile, iterative, software design and development process
What were the key findings?
-	The geography data published at OpenFDA for recall enforcement is currently oriented toward the manufacturer. However, the geography data associated from the distribution perspective is published in a freeform text field, making it challenging to render on a map for visualization, as well as being able to search for normalized geographies (i.e. MD vs. Maryland).
How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
-	The findings were documented in the project repository, under “docs”.
How often are you testing with “people”?
-	Every other business day during prototyping phase.
What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
-	This prototype assumes that isn’t being done automatically based on the data structure provided. For the sake of this prototype, there was not adequate time to determine.
Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
-	TBD.
Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
-	TBD.
What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?
-	Use of Google Analytics for adoption rate.
What primary tasks is the user trying to accomplish?
-	TBD.
